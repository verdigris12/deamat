"""
The :mod:`deamat` package provides a minimal wrapper around imgui and
matplotlib to ease the construction of immediate‑mode graphical interfaces.

The top‑level namespace re‑exports the core classes and functions used by most
applications:

* :class:`deamat.gui.GUI` – the main application window and event loop.
* :class:`deamat.guistate.GUIState` – a simple container for user state and
  figure definitions.
* :mod:`imgui` – imported from imgui_bundle and re‑exported to ensure a
  consistent implementation throughout your application.
